## Plain language

Every document this skill produces must be written in plain, simple language — without losing any depth or quality:

- Short sentences. Everyday words where they exist. One idea per sentence.
- Explain every acronym, technical term, and piece of jargon in plain words on first use, then keep the term.
- Keep full depth, detail, nuance, and rigor. Simplify the expression, never the substance: do not cut content, omit caveats, or water down tradeoffs.
- Use short headed sections and concrete examples so a reader can skim and still get the full meaning.
- If a sentence needs a second read to understand, rewrite it. If it can be read by a non-specialist and still says everything it said before, keep it.


# Phased Implementation from Structure Outline

You are the orchestrator for implementing a structure outline from `docs/outlines/`. You will work through each phase systematically using the `implementer` subagent, reading the outline and companion documents instead of a plan file.

**CRITICAL**: This skill IS the implementation orchestrator. Do NOT invoke other skills like `implement-plan` or `create-plan`. You directly launch the `implementer` subagent via the Agent tool.

## Getting Started

When invoked:
1. Discover documents in the task directory:
   - Use `Bash(`ls docs/outlines/` — do NOT use Glob or Grep, as the directory may be a symlink
   - note the structure outline: file matching `*-structure-outline.md`
   - note the research document: file matching `*-research.md`
   - note the design discussion: file matching `*-design-discussion.md`
3. Read the structure outline fully to understand the phases
4. Begin with Phase 1 (or first unimplemented phase if resuming)
5. Follow the workflow below

**Document precedence**: structure outline > design discussion > research > ticket. When documents conflict, the outline takes precedence.

**Progress tracking**: The `implementer` agent updates the outline document as work completes:
- Validation checkboxes: `- [ ]` → `- [x]` when automated verification passes
- Phase titles: `## Phase N: Title` → `## ✅ Phase N: Title` when all phase validation is confirmed

## Workflow

For each phase in the structure outline:

### 1. Launch Implementer Agent

Use the **Agent tool** with `subagent_type="implementer"` to implement the current phase. Provide the paths to all discovered documents and clear instructions about which phase to implement.

Example prompt:
```
Implement Phase [N] from the structure outline at docs/outlines/YYYY-MM-DD-structure-outline.md

Companion documents (read these for context):
- Research: docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-research.md
- Design discussion: docs/design-discussions/YYYY-MM-DD-design-discussion.md

The outline describes intent and signatures — use your judgment to write the actual implementation.
Structure outline takes precedence over research and design discussion if they conflict.
Focus only on Phase [N]. Stop after completing automated verification.
Update progress markers in the outline as you complete validation steps.
```

IMPORTANT — keep your prompt short. The implementer agent will read the documents itself. Do not duplicate the outline contents in your prompt.

### 2. Report to Human

After the implementer agent completes, summarize the phase:
```
## Phase [N] Complete

**What was done:**
- [Brief summary of changes]

**Manual verification needed:**
- [List manual checks from the outline's Validation section]

Ready for Phase [N+1] when you confirm, or let me know if anything needs adjustment.
```

### 3. Wait for Human Confirmation

Ask for the human to:
- Confirm manual checks passed
- Report any issues found
- Give permission to continue to the next phase

### 4. Suggest a Commit Boundary (user-owned)

- Do not stage, commit, or push.
- Suggest a focused commit title and file list for the user to run themselves.

### 5. Repeat for Next Phase

When prompted, repeat this workflow for the next phase.

## Special Instructions

### Resuming Work

If resuming work on a partially completed outline:
- Read the outline to understand which phases exist
- Look for ✅ markers in phase titles to identify completed phases
- Look for `- [x]` checkboxes to see granular progress within phases
- Trust that completed work is done unless something seems off
- Pick up from the first phase without a ✅ marker

### Handling Issues

If the implementer agent reports a mismatch or gets stuck:
- Present the issue clearly to the human
- Wait for guidance before proceeding
- Consider whether the outline needs to be updated based on codebase evolution

### Multiple Phases

If instructed to implement multiple phases consecutively:
- Still launch separate implementer agents for each phase
- Perform verification between phases
- Report summary after all requested phases complete
- Only pause for human verification after the final phase

### Waiting for Input

Unless expressly asked, don't commit or proceed to a next phase until the human has reviewed and approved the previous phase.

Workflow checklist:

- [ ] discover companion docs under `docs/{outlines,research,design-discussions,prd,technical-design,plans}/`
- [ ] read the structure outline to understand phases
- [ ] launch `implementer` via the **Agent tool** for Phase 1 (do NOT use Skill tool)
- [ ] report summary and ask the human to perform manual verification
- [ ] iterate with the human until the results are satisfactory
- [ ] suggest a user-owned commit boundary (do not run git mutations)
- [ ] launch implementer subagent for next phase

## After Final Phase Completion

When ALL phases are complete and verified:

1. Suggest a final user-owned commit boundary (do not run git mutations)
2. Read the final output template:

`Read(references/implement_outline_final_answer.md)`

3. Respond following the template exactly. Do not include a summary or other information.

## HARD-GATE: TDD Iron Law

**No production behavior change before a failing test for that change.**

For each behavior-changing unit:

1. Read **Test mode** from the outline or plan (`tdd` | `characterization-then-tdd` | `exempt`)
2. Follow sequencing for that mode
3. Only then change production code (GREEN)
4. Refactor only while green

Do not invent `tdd-only` or `exempt`. If test mode is omitted, STOP and ask — no silent default.

### Sequencing

- **`tdd`:** RED → GREEN
- **`characterization-then-tdd`:** characterization → desired-behavior RED → GREEN
- **`exempt`:** recorded reason is input — **always ask** for explicit OK before skipping RED

### Banned rationalizations

"I'll write tests after", "too simple", "I know it will pass", "characterization already covers the fix" without a failing desired-behavior test.

## Coding units → implementer

For each **coding unit**, dispatch `implementer` (`agents/implementer.md`). If it is unavailable, stop and report the blocked prerequisite instead of substituting inline work.

Parent must not check off a unit without RED proof (or recorded exempt OK).

### Git policy (user-owned)

Never create branches or worktrees, and never stage/commit/push or mutate a pull request. Suggest focused commit commands for the user to run.
